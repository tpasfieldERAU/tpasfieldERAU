### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Here you'll find code for my random projects, largely related to math computing and display! You'll also find some code for my work as the software lead for ERAU's SUAS competition team. Feel free to use my code for your own exploration, and please attribute me if you use any in a more signficant project.


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: 
  - Developing a graphing calculator engine from the bare basics!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: 
  - Grammar and Language Analysis for a Recursive Descent Parser!    
  - Lambda Calculus    
  - Category Theory
  - Graph Theory    
- âš¡ Fun fact:
  - I occasionally speedsolve Rubik's cubes! You might see some related repos here in the future for that!
      
Feel free to contact me here on Github, at my Twitter, or any other public contact I put here!
