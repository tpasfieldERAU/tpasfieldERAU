### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Here you'll find code for my random projects, largely related to math computing and display! Feel free to use my code for your own exploration, and please attribute me if you use any in a more signficant project.


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: 
  - CT Simulation of 3D-prints for Deep Learning Segmentation Training (Research Capstone)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: 
  - GStreamer pipelines, applied signal processing, and catching up on SOTA computer vision.
- âš¡ Fun fact:
  - I occasionally speedsolve Rubik's cubes! You might see some related repos here in the future for that!
      
Feel free to contact me here on Github, at my Twitter, or any other public contact I put here!
